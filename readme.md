1) Go to downloaded folder and install dependencies
    cd ./htmlparse
    npm i
    npm -D nodemon (if you want to be in develop mode)

    In this project, I wrote the url inside the document.
3) Run program
    npm run start
    npm run dev (dev mode)
4) You can see the result in ./output folder or you can see the return value of function named downloadAndParseHtml(fileURL, destnation);
